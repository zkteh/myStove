# This IoT will 
1. monitor the food temperature to know whether the stove is warming, cooling, heating or off.
2. alert user to go back to the cooking region with the help of PIR motion sensor

# Limitation
1. pan tempearture is impossible due to low sensitivity of the OEM brand MLX90614 sensor 
2. food temperature is not accurate due to same reason as above
3. only works for one pan
4. user is not allowed to cover the pan with lid

# Things I learnt
1. Python doesn't like inconsitently mixed tabs and spaces for indentation, use VScode to convert indentation into tabs/spaces
